# sentiment-analysis-with-neural-network
This project is build up completely with numpy.
It implements basic neural network concepts including backpropagation,
hidden layers, activation function and gradient descent.

First run 'setup.sh' in bash. This will set up the project for you.

To run the project, open 'run_me.py'. The terminal must show the following:
